## Overview
Purpose of this analysis is to perform a review of Citi Bike Data for New York City using Tableau. Data will have type modification using Python in Jupyter Notebook


Summary of Visualizations Used -- Including Summary Text found in Tableau

Course 1 Dashboard--Story pg1
Course: Number of Trips
Course: Customer Type
Course: Gender Breakdown
Course: August Peak Hours
Course: Average Trip Duration Summary Text:

 Initial Charts:
 --Total Number of Trips:  Raw count of records
 --Breakdown by Customer Type:  Subscriber Favored
 --Breakdown by Gender:  Male Favored & subset of indeterminant gender present
 --August Peak Hours:  High @ 5pm, Low @ 4am

Challenge 1 Dashboard--Story pg3
Challenge: Checkout Times for Users
Challenge: Checkout TImes for Genders Summary Text:
Comparison of Checkout Time Duration of Overall versus Gender Breakdown shows how MALE riders skew majority of data trend.
For both genders, peak trip duration is 4~6 hours with FEMALE being slightly higher than MALE.
Challenge 2 Dashboard--Story pg4
Challenge: Trips by Weekday per Hour Heatmap
Challenge: User Trips by Gender by Weekday Heatmap Summary Text:
Heat Map of rider count.

FIRST
Overall breakdown according to time of day and day of week.
This shows heaviest usage during peak commute hours of:
6am ~ 9am & 4pm ~ 7pm during Monday through Friday.
Weekend hours have even distribution throughout day from 10am ~ 5pm.

SECOND
Breakdown by Gender & User Type across days of the week.
Most significant observation is large MALE distribution on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday for Subscriber types.
Challenge 3 Dashboard--Story pg5

Challenge: Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)
Course Visualization Count = 9 Challenge Visualization Count = 5 Summary Text:

Final heat map expands on the overall breakdown according to time of day and day of week.with inclusion of Gender display.

Observation continues to highlight majority of MALE riders.  
Of interest is that while FEMALE riders are fewer, their distribution of usage during weekdays and weekends is similar to MALE riders.

6am ~ 9am & 4pm ~ 7pm during Monday through Friday.
Weekend hours have even distribution throughout day from 10am ~ 5pm.
Summary
Overall this was a very interesting first use of Tableau to visualize data. The level of customization and additional features are apparent especially in relation to Excel used during beginning of course. Additionally, the learning curve is not quite as steep compared to the Python & Javascript visualizations performed in previous modules.

If I were to explore this particualr data set further, I would consider a deeper dive into:

Gender & User Type differences with the majority data sets removed (MALE & SUBSCRIBER) to see if there is any further detail which can be obtained from minority user groups.
Consider application of time as a layer to the geographical mapping to visualize peak and trough usage over the course of the day and to check if there is any geographic relationship.
